Changes file for Chess::Coverage

0.01 2008.08.02
    - Scrapped everything but the interface when I saw that the
      Chess::Rep module could do what I wanted with less code and in
      about 1/5th the execution speed.

0.00_4 2007.07.02
    - Fixed the coverage() function.

0.00_3 2007...?

0.00_2 2007.04.07
    - Lifted the "line_is_open" and "move_is_legal" functions of the
      Chess module and modified them, ever so slightly, for coverage
      analysis.

0.00_1 2007.03.10
    - Began the de-crustification, simplification, cleanup, rewrite of
      the old Games::Chess::Coverage packages.
